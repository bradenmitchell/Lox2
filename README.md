# CLox

This repository tracks my progress developing a bytecode-virtual-machine-based interpreter, implemented in C, for Lox as described in [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html).

Lox is a high-level interpreted and dynamically-typed scripting language. An overview of the language and its syntax is described [here](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html).
